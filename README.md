HEALTHCARE PATIENT BILLING AND ADMISSION ANA![HEALTHCARE DASHBOARD BY RAWJENNY](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25e96045-036b-45a8-ae57-f09e7914689d)
LYSIS REPORT FOR 2019-2024: This analysis examines patient medical records over a defined period, focusing on demographic profiles, prevalent medical conditions, treatment costs, and admission types, and how these factors influence the efficiency of healthcare delivery and financial management within medical institutions.

Below are my insights/observations and Recommendation:

OBSERVATIONS:

1. Medicare is the Best Insurance Provider by Billing Amount

Medicare has the highest billing amount compared to other insurance providers, indicating that it covers a significant number of high-cost treatments.

Other providers such as Blue Cross, Aetna, and Cigna have similar billing amounts but are slightly lower.

 

2. Elective Admissions Generate the Highest Billing Amount

Elective admissions have the highest average billing amount ($25,602.23), surpassing urgent and emergency admissions.

This suggests that planned procedures, possibly including surgeries and specialized treatments, are more costly than emergency cases.

 

3. Billing Amounts Have Declined Over the Years (2019-2024)

There is a noticeable decline in billing amounts from 2019 to 2024, dropping from $25,700.46 in 2019 to $25,380.30 in 2024. This could indicate improved healthcare cost management, changes in treatment costs, or shifts in patient volume.

 

4. Age Group Billing Amounts are Almost Equal

All age groups (13-32, 33-52, 53-72, and 73-92) have nearly identical billing averages, suggesting no significant cost differences based on age. This implies that medical expenses may be more influenced by condition severity rather than age alone.

 

5. Males Have Slightly Higher Billing Than Females

Male patients have an average billing amount of $25,607.86, slightly higher than the female average of $25,470.65. This might indicate that men are receiving costlier treatments or have more severe medical conditions requiring higher expenses.

 

6. Cancer, Diabetes, and Obesity are the Most Expensive Medical Conditions

The billing amounts for these conditions exceed $230 million, with Diabetes and Obesity having the highest total costs.

These conditions are likely to require long-term treatments, specialized care, and expensive medications, increasing overall costs.

 

7. Johnson PLC is the Most Expensive Hospital

Johnson PLC has the highest billing amount ($1,084,202.69), followed by Smith PLC and Smith Ltd.

This could be due to its specialization in high-cost treatments or a higher volume of patients.

 

8. Total Average Revenue is $25,539.32

The hospital system generates an average revenue of $25,539.32 per patient, meaning most treatments fall within this range.

Understanding this benchmark helps in financial planning and comparing the efficiency of different hospitals.

 

9. Emergency Admissions Have Lower Billing Amounts Compared to Elective Admissions

Despite being urgent, emergency admissions ($25,497.40) have lower billing amounts than elective admissions.

This may be due to emergency treatments being quick interventions rather than prolonged treatments that drive up costs.

 

10. Billing Across Hospitals Shows Significant Variation

Johnson PLC has the highest total billing, whereas Smith Ltd has the lowest ($970,035.87).

This variation could be due to differences in patient volume, specialization, or regional pricing structures.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

 

1. Review Insurance Billing Trends

Hospitals should analyze why Medicare has the highest billing and whether it reflects actual patient needs or overbilling patterns. A comparison with private insurance providers can help balance patient coverage and cost efficiency.

 

2. Optimize Elective Admission Pricing

Since elective admissions generate the most revenue, hospitals should optimize pricing strategies to ensure fair yet profitable pricing. Additional patient financing options for elective procedures should be considered.

 

3. Investigate the Decline in Billing Amounts Over the Years

A deeper analysis should be done to understand why billing amounts have been decreasing since 2019. If it’s due to cost reductions, that’s positive, but if it’s from lower patient volume, hospitals need new strategies to attract more patients.

 

4. Understand Gender-Based Differences in Billing

Further analysis should be conducted to understand why male patients have slightly higher billing amounts than females. If it’s due to more severe conditions or longer hospital stays, healthcare policies should be adjusted to provide equal care opportunities.

 

5. Increase Preventive Care for High-Cost Diseases

Since Diabetes, Obesity, and Cancer have the highest treatment costs, hospitals should focus on preventive care programs to reduce long-term expenses. Investing in early diagnosis and lifestyle programs can reduce the financial burden on both hospitals and patients.


6. Assess Cost Efficiency Across Hospitals

Johnson PLC, as the most expensive hospital, should evaluate its pricing structure to ensure competitive pricing.

Hospitals with lower billing amounts might need resource optimization to increase profitability without overcharging patients.

 

7. Encourage More Emergency Admission Efficiency

Since emergency admissions have lower average billing, hospitals should improve emergency department efficiency to optimize patient flow and revenue.

Cost-effective treatment models should be implemented without reducing quality.

 

8. Expand Services in High-Billing Specialties

Since elective admissions and chronic conditions (Diabetes, Cancer, Obesity) generate high revenue, hospitals should invest in expanding these departments.

This could include hiring more specialists, upgrading equipment, or offering specialized treatment packages.

 

9. Monitor and Adjust Average Revenue Benchmarks

The average revenue per patient is $25,539.32, and hospitals should use this as a baseline to measure financial efficiency.

Cost structures should be adjusted to maintain profitability while keeping services affordable for patients.

 

10. Standardize Pricing Across Hospitals

The variation in hospital billing suggests a need for pricing standardization across facilities. Transparency in medical pricing should be improved to help patients make informed decisions about where to seek treatment.
